# Check-ins and peer reviews

This guide explains how the check-in and peer review system works. This version
is aimed at staff and supervisors.

## How check-ins work

Studies have shown that in long-term group projects, students unhappy about the
workload balance tend to let these feelings build until the end. They then
complain to staff but with limited evidence and far too late to take any action
other than retrospectively adjusting marks.

Check-ins aim to solve this asking students to regularly review the team's
progress, effort balance and dynamics. This provides the module team with
longitudinal data from throughout the project that can be used to flag teams
who may be struggling and intervene before problems get worse. The data also
provides evidence in case of sustained issues and can be used to justify marking
decisions.

Check-ins are highly configurable to meet your assignment's needs. There are two
types to choose from:

* **Simple** check-ins that gather opinions about relative effort from each team
member.
* **Full** check-ins that additionally ask students to complete a short peer
review about each team-mate.

Check-ins are completed weekly by students, though the module staff can control
whether a simple or full check-in is required each week (or none at all). The
data collected is analysed by the app to generate intelligent insights about
teams and is also exportable as a report.

### Simple check-ins

A simple check-in is a single question asking students about the workload
balance in their team that week. They answer by rebalancing a fixed number of
"effort points" between their team-mates, including themselves.

This produces numeric results that represent the perceived effort among the
team. In particular, it allows for comparison between the effort an individual
says they put in compared to the effort reported by others.

list of student names and each one has 7 circles beside it. There is help text
explaining that the student should rebalance the circles to reflect that week's
effort balance in the team.](../../images/simple-check-in.png)

### Full check-ins

A full check-in asks the same question but also includes a more detailed peer
review. For each of their team-mates, the student gives a star rating for a
series of staff-configured skills. These could be soft skills such as
communication or punctuality, or technical skills related to the assignment.

They then also provide a short review comment for the other student, telling
them what they've done well that week and what they could do to improve. These
comments can be viewed and moderated by supervisors or module staff.

rating questions with a series of skills. Underneath this there is a longer text
box prompting the student to enter written review comment.](../../images/full-check-in.png)

## Setting up check-ins

Check-ins can be configured in detail to suit your assignment. This should be
done at the start (before allocating teams) and is done from the assignment's
"Configure" page, under "Peer reviews".

1. Start by toggling peer reviews to enable them.
2. Set the dates. For the start date, use the day that you plan to allocate
teams and for the end date, the final submission date. Even if you don't plan to
ask peer reviews until a few weeks in, set the start date as described as this
will give you flexibility to change it later.
3. After setting the dates, a box will appear for each week of the assignment.
For each week, choose whether you want a simple or full check-in or nothing at
all. It's suggested to have a simple check-in weekly, full check-in after each
major milestone and nothing during holidays.
4. For any full check-ins, set the skills that you want students to rate each
other on. These can be the same or different for each check-in.
5. If it's helpful, you can name specific check-ins. For example, if you've
configured a full check-in after each handin you could give them names like
"Submission #1". Names will be visible to students.
6. **Save your changes** using the button at the top-right of the peer reviews
tab.

> [!WARNING]
> Once students have started working, don't edit check-ins for previous or
current weeks and don't change the start date in the peer review settings. Doing
so may cause check-in data to be lost.
