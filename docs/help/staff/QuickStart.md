# Staff quick-start guide

This is a quick-start guide to help you set up and manage an assignment in the
app. Note that this will skip over many of the advanced features, so it's
recommended that you also check out the other guides later.

## Creating a new assignment

To get started, log in and go to your dashboard. Then click the "New assignment"
button in the top right. If you don't see this, you'll need to ask an admin of
the system to do it for you.

Give your assignment a name (module code and year works well, e.g. COMP2300
25/26) and a short description (e.g. module name). These will be visible to all.

Next, select it from the dashboard list or the sidebar. You'll see a page with
a progress bar and some cards - this is your assignment overview. There won't be
much here at the moment, but later on it'll show you key insights.

### Adding other module staff

Choose the "Configure" option from the sidebar and open the "Module staff" tab.
Here you can enter the email addresses of any other staff who need access.
Remember to save your changes!

If you're having trouble, make sure you enter the email address that appears for
them on their own profile page. Please note they'll need to have previously
logged into the app before they can be added here.

### Adding students

Head to the "Students" page in the sidebar. Make sure you have a CSV of students
for this assignment ready - it needs to contain their email address and name.
Upload this file using the box on the right.

If you need to add more students later on, just upload another file and they'll
be added too.

## Running the skills questionnaire

Before each assignment, it's worth asking students to self-report their 
confidence levels in some key required skills. You can use this data during
allocation and it'll also be shown to teams to highlight key strengths.
