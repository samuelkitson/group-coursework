# Introduction

Welcome! This is the staff help guide for groups.ecs and should explain how to
use the system, as well as giving some tips and tricks for getting the most out
of it. It's designed to help you manage all stages of group coursework
assignments, from creating teams to monitoring group progress. It aims to
provide functionality for staff, students and supervisors and reduce your
overall workload.

## Key features

* Allocates teams based on a range of data sources, including self-reported
skills ratings.
* Assigns supervisors to teams.
* Allows students to record meeting minutes and attendance in one place.
* Monitors team progress and automatically flags potential issues.
* Gathers regular peer reviews from students to inform marking.
* Generates progress reports about individual teams.
* ...and quite a lot more!

## Assignment lifecycle

Within the app, assignments move through the five states below:

1. **Getting ready**: initial setup; students, supervisors and staff added.
2. **Allocation questions**: students self-report confidence in key skills.
3. **Finalising allocation**: allocate teams using an interactive tool.
4. **Working in teams**: students working together in teams on the assignment.
5. **Finished**: an archive "read-only" state for after everyone's finished.
