# Teams page

The teams page gives you an overview of how each team is getting on. Staff can
see all teams on an assignment and supervisors can see those they supervise.
This page becomes available as soon as you have allocated teams.

## Team insights

Beside each team listed on the page you'll see some colour-coded insights. These
are automatically generated from a range of data and can be positive (green),
negative (yellow) or severe (red). The data sources are:

* Days since the last meeting.
* Meeting attendance.
* Disputes about meeting minutes.
* Check-in completion rate.
* Workload balance from check-ins.

Additionally, individual students will be flagged if data indicates they may be
struggling. A red icon will appear next to their name if any of the following
apply:

* Low meeting attendance.
* Low effort (as reported by other team members).

Note that insights related to effort or check-ins will only appear if peer
reviews have been enabled.

> [!TIP]
> You can filter the page to only show teams with severe alerts, for example.
> This is useful for quickly identifying which teams may need support.

## Team options

In the top-right corner of each team's box, you'll see a dropdown menu (⋮).
Clicking this reveals a number of options and shortcuts:

* **Email team**: opens an email in your default email client with the team
members' email addresses prefilled.
* **Meetings**: view and edit the team's meeting minutes. If any team members
have disputed the record of a meeting, you can view and respond to them here.
[Learn more](./MeetingDisputes.md).
* **Peer reviews**: if peer reviews are enabled, you can analyse and moderate
the student responses here. [Learn more](./CheckIns.md).
* **Observations**: used to view and record private notes about teams and team
members. These are only visible to supervisors and staff, and are included in
downloadable reports to aid marking. [Learn more](./Observations.md).
* **Progress report**: a shortcut to download progress reports for this team.
[Learn more](./Reports.md).

## Exporting a list of teams

You can export a CSV containing a list of students and their team numbers. This
is useful for importing into other systems, such as Moodle. The CSV has the
following columns:

* `email`: the student's email address (User Principal Name).
* `team`: the student's team number.

## Moving students between teams

Sometimes it may be necessary to move students between teams after they have
already been allocated. Use the following steps to do this:

1. Click the "Move students" button to begin. You can click it again at any
point to cancel the move.
2. Click the name of the student to be moved.
3. To move them to an existing team, click the team's number. To move them to a
brand new empty team, click the link shown at the very top of the list.

The student will then be moved and immediately able to access their new team's
details. They will not be notified automatically, so you should contact their
new team to alert them. You can do this by opening the team menu (⋮) and then
choosing "Email team".

They'll still appear in old meeting minutes, attendance logs, supervisor
observations and meeting disputes for their old team. They won't appear in
downloadable reports.

> [!CAUTION]
> Check-in and peer review data about the student in their old team will be
> inaccessible. If you need it, you should therefore take a copy (e.g. download
> a team report) before performing the move.
