# Supervisor quick start guide

This is a short guide to get you started with the group coursework system as a
supervisor. Not every feature will be covered, so you should check the other
guides for help with more advanced features.

## What does this system do?

This system is designed to help manage group coursework assignments. There are 
tools to help with every stage, from allocating teams to monitoring their
progress.

Students should track their meetings and progress within the system. This means
that everyone in the team, including you, has easy access to the latest meeting
minutes and that there's plenty of evidence in case of disputes about workload.

If configured by the module team, students may also need to complete regular
peer reviews in the system. These are called "check-ins" and help give you and
staff an overview of any potential issues.

## What do I need to do as a supervisor?

You should check with your module team for the specifics of your role, but in
the context of this system there are a few key responsibilities you have:

* Meet with your teams regularly to check how they're getting on.
* Support them with recording accurate meeting minutes in the system.
* Respond to any disputes logged about meetings.
* Monitor check-in results to identify any issues.
* Record private observations about team and individual issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some features above might be unavailable if they haven't been configured by
> the lecturer.

## Viewing your teams

Once you've logged in, you should see a list of your current assignments on the
dashboard. Click the one you need to select it, and you'll see the sidebar
expand with the pages you can view. You won't be able to do anything until the
module team has assigned you to some teams.

After this has happened, click the "Teams" page in the sidebar. You'll see a
list of your teams and the students in them.

Check out the [staff guide about the Teams page](../staff/TeamsPage.md) for more
information. Bear in mind that you'll only be able to see the teams you
supervise, and you won't have access to some of the administrative tools.

## Observations

An important part of your role as a supervisor is to make private notes about 
how your team is getting on. These will help the lecturers understand how well
the team (and its individual members) worked together and might be used to
inform marking decisions. You can find out more about them [here](../staff/Observations.md).

## Meetings and disputes

You should keep an eye on the Meeting page for each team to make sure that:

* They are recording all of their meetings in the app.
* The meeting minutes are professional, detailed and accurate.
* The attendance logs are accurate.

If students disagree with the meeting minutes recorded by another team member,
they might log a dispute about it. You need to respond to and attempt to resolve
this dispute. Find out more [here](../staff/MeetingDisputes.md).

## Check-ins and peer reviews

If configured by the lecturer, students will complete regular "check-ins" and
peer reviews to report on how the workload balance has been in their teams.
These are completed weekly and you should encourage students to engage with it.

As a supervisor, you can also view the submitted responses to identify potential
issues and support your teams. You might also be asked to moderate peer review
comments. Find out more at the end of [this guide](../staff/CheckIns.md).

## Progress reports

As a supervisor, you can also generate and view progress reports about your
teams. This can give you valuable insights into how the teams are getting on and
whether there are group dynamics issues that you might need to support them
with. Read the [staff guide](../staff/Reports.md) about reports to learn more.
