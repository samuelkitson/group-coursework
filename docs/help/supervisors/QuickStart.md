# Supervisor quick start guide

This is a short guide to get you started with the group coursework system as a
supervisor. Not every feature will be covered, so you should check the other
guides for help with more advanced features.

## What does this system do?

This system is designed to help manage group coursework assignments. There are 
tools to help with every stage, from allocating teams to monitoring their
progress.

Students should track their meetings and progress within the system. This means
that everyone in the team, including you, has easy access to the latest meeting
minutes and that there's plenty of evidence in case of disputes about workload.

If configured by the module team, students may also need to complete regular
peer reviews in the system. These are called "check-ins" and help give you and
staff an overview of any potential issues.

## What do I need to do as a supervisor?

You should check with your module team for the specifics of your role, but in
the context of this system there are a few key responsibilities you have:

* Meet with your teams regularly to check how they're getting on.
* Support them with recording accurate meeting minutes in the system.
* Respond to any disputes logged about meetings.
* Monitor check-in results to identify any issues.
* Record private observations about team and individual issues.

## Viewing your teams

Once you've logged in, you should see a list of your current assignments on the
dashboard. Click the one you need to select it, and you'll see the sidebar
expand with the pages you can view. You won't be able to do anything until the
module team has assigned you to some teams.

After this has happened, click the "Teams" page in the sidebar. You'll see a
list of your teams and the students in them.
