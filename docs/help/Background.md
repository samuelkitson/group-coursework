# Project background

This system originated as a Third Year Project in 2024/25 by Sam Kitson,
supervised by Dr Richard Gomer. The original goals were to design, build and
test a system to improve the group coursework experience for both staff and
students in Electronics and Computer Science. The [project report](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp3200/e_archive/COMP3200/2425/sk6g22/project.html) is visible to current ECS members.

The following summer, the project was extended for use in undergraduate teaching
in ECS.
