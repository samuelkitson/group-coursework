# Skills questionnaire

This guide for students is about the skills questionnaire that your lecturers
might ask you to complete before they allocate teams.

The questionnaire has one question and only takes a minute or two to complete.
It asks you to rate your confidence in a set of skills that are important for
the group coursework.

You just need to move each slider until it accurately represents how confident
you feel at each skill. Remember to click "Save ratings" when you're done!

## When will I be asked to complete it?

If your lecturer has set this up, they'll ask you to complete it at the very
start of the project, before teams are allocated. You might receive automated
reminder emails from the system.

## Can I change my answers?

Yes, as long as the questionnaire is still open. Just go to the Allocation page
in the sidebar and adjust your answers.

## Who can see my answers?

Your answers will be visible to your lecturers, alongside other data such as
your average marks. Your top-rated skill will be visible to the other people in
your team, but they won't see which rating you gave it.

## Should I answer honestly?

Yes! Your lecturer might use this data to help create teams where there's at
least one person confident in each skill. If you lie, you might find that you're
placed in a team that's missing key skills.

As your team will also be able to see your top-rated skill, you'll probably find
that the tasks you assign suit each of your skillsets well. This won't be the
case if you answer dishonestly.
